The best combination of the six important players in the volleyball team (1, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12) should follow the following rules:
 Players 4 and 6 need to play together.
 Player 3 does not play the game if and only if player 1 does not play.
 Either player 3 or player 6 should appear on the court, and they can not appear at the same time.
 If players 9 and 12 are on the court, then player 4 must be on the court.
 If players 1 and 12 need to play at the same time in one game, who of the other 4 players should play?

a. p4 <-> p6
b. -p1 <-> -p3
