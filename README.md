## Projects

#### 1. Information Exposure Maximization (IEM)

- Monte Carlo Estimation: Approximates the objective value by simulating the diffusion process multiple times.

- Greedy Best-First Search: A heuristic approach to find near-optimal seed sets efficiently.

- Evolutionary Algorithm: Explores a broader solution space using selection, crossover, and mutation to optimize seed sets.

#### 2. Image Classification and Feature Selection

- Supervised Learning for Image Classification: Implemented a Softmax Regression model for image classification using preprocessed image vectors.

- Unsupervised Learning for Image Retrieval: Developed a Nearest Neighbor Search (NNS) system using Euclidean and cosine similarity for content-based image retrieval.

- Feature Selection: Compared random selection with SelectKBest (ANOVA F-test) for dimensionality reduction.

#### 3. Knowledge Graph-Based Recommender System (KGRS)

- TransE Model: Learns embeddings for users, items, and relations in a low-dimensional space to capture relationships in the knowledge graph.
